# javascript_playground

This is a small collection of my baby web development programs/projects so I can practice essential HTML/CSS/JS development skills.


Some of the projects here are based off of assignments from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), while others are just ideas I have wanted to personally program myself.
